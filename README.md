Quick and dirty prototype of a board game I played as a child to get familiar with Rust and the Bevy engine.

Get yourself a Rust tool chain (e.g. https://rustup.rs/) and build it with "cargo build".
Thats it.

Controls for the game:
Left arrow key - move chip left
Right arrow key - move chip right
Spacebar - drop the chip
